## Monday, Jan 9

#### Introduction to `ggplot2`

* [Slides](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/cmsc205/notes/blob/master/day02/ggplot-notes.html)

* [Births78.csv](https://github.com/cmsc205/data/raw/master/Birth78.csv)


#### For next time

* Complete chapters 3--5 of [Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r).

* Read about bar charts, boxplots, density plots, histograms, line charts, and scatterplots on [The Data Visualisation Catalogue](http://www.datavizcatalogue.com/).

#### After-class updates

As pointed out in class, we need to manually convert the `date` column of the data set from a character vector to a date format. The below code chunk can be used to read in the data set and complete this conversion:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(lubridate) # for the as_date function

# Read in and convert
Births78 <- read.csv("https://github.com/cmsc205/data/raw/master/Birth78.csv")
Births78$date <- as_date(Births78$date)

# Check the structure to make sure that date is of the Date format
```
